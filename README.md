Constrained Self-Avoiding Chromatin

## Installation

1- Code requires installation of cmake and boost and eigen3 libraries.

2- After libraries are installed, make sure to change the paths in CMakeLists.txt file.

3- Create a folder called build in the directory where you have the code 
  ```
  cd build 
  cmake .. 
  make 
  ```
  
Above should compile the code. Hopefully no error.

## Running

4- to test, I have a test configuration file in the folder. You can run it as 
```
../build/bin/chromatin.sis.coarse -conf <<.ini file>> -prefix AA
```

The components
```
../build/bin/chromatin.sis.coarse  = executable created after building the code 
<<.ini file>> = configuration file needed to point to the input files 
AA = prefix for the output chain files. 
```
This helps to iterate over when creating multiple chains. 

## Brief explanation of the <<.ini>> file
```
out_path = output path
persistence_length = length of each unit in A (e.g. 30 nm chromatin fiber will have 30, each 10nm is a kb long) )
collision_length = 300 (in A, this is the diameter of each bead)
nucleus_sphere_diameter = 5200 (nucleus diameter in A)
number_nodes = number of beads in the chain (i.e., the total length of the chain is number of nodes x 3 kb) 
number_of_chains = number of chains equal to 1 for this code
chain_length_0 = same as number of nodes
number_sample_points = divides the sampling sphere around a monomer to 640 distrete points
```
